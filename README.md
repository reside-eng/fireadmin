## Getting Started

If you are just getting started with Fireadmin, it is probably best to checkout the [hosted version at fireadmin.io](http://fireadmin.io). After you become more familiar, feel free to run your own by pulling this source and proceeding to the [run your own section](#run-your-own).

### Requirements
* node `^6.0.0` (`6.11.5` suggested to match [Cloud Functions Runtime][functions-runtime-url])

## Running Your Own

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install` (can also be done with `npm install`)
1. Create a file `src/config.js` to look like so (generated using [`firebase-ci`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-ci) in CI environments):

  ```js
  export const version = "0.1.9"; // matches package.json when using firebase-ci in CI environment

  export const env = "local"; // matches branch/project when using firebase-ci in CI environment

  // Get from Auth Tab with Firebase's Console
  // matches branch/project settings when using firebase-ci in CI environment
  export const firebase = {
    apiKey: "<- api key ->",
    authDomain: "<- auth domain ->",
    databaseURL: "<- database URL ->",
    projectId: "<- project ID ->",
    storageBucket: "<- storageBucket ->",
    messagingSenderId: "<- message sender ID ->",
  };

  export const reduxFirebase = {
    userProfile: "users",
    enableLogging: false,
    updateProfileOnLogin: true,
    useFirestoreForProfile: true,
  };

  // Google Analytics Tracking ID (leave blank for no analytics)
  export const analyticsTrackingId = "";

  // Stackdriver client side error reporting
  export const googleApis = {
    apiKey: "",
  };

  // Algolia project info (for searching of User's Public Info and Public Templates)
  export const algolia = {
    appId: "",
    apiKey: "",
  };

  export default {
    version,
    env,
    firebase,
    reduxFirebase,
    analyticsTrackingId,
    googleApis,
    algolia
  }
  ```
1. Change settings in `.firebaserc` to match your own Firebase credentials
1. Start Development server: `yarn start`

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` and displays [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`start:simple`     |Serves your app at `localhost:3000` without [Webpack Dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)|
|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|
|`test`             |Runs unit tests with Karma. See [testing](#testing)|
|`test:watch`       |Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|
|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|
|`lint:fix`         |Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix)|

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to enable `prepush` hook capability. The `prepush` script currently runs `eslint`, which will keep you from pushing if there is any lint within your code. If you would like to disable this, remove the `prepush` script from the `package.json`.

```

### Deployment

1. Install Firebase Command Line Tool: `npm i -g firebase-tools`

#### CI Deploy (recommended)
**Note**: Config for this is located within `travis.yml`
`firebase-ci` has been added to simplify the CI deployment process. All that is required is providing authentication with Firebase:

1. Login: `firebase login:ci` to generate an authentication token (will be used to give Travis-CI rights to deploy on your behalf)
1. Set `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable within Travis-CI environment
1. Run a build on Travis-CI

If you would like to deploy to different Firebase instances for different branches (i.e. `prod`), change `ci` settings within `.firebaserc`.

For more options on CI settings checkout the [firebase-ci docs](https://github.com/prescottprue/firebase-ci)

#### Manual deploy

1. Run `firebase:login`
1. Initialize project with `firebase init` then answer:
  * What file should be used for Database Rules?  -> `database.rules.json`
  * What do you want to use as your public directory? -> `build`
  * Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? -> `Yes`
  * What Firebase project do you want to associate as default?  -> **your Firebase project name**
1. Build Project: `npm run build`
1. Confirm Firebase config by running locally: `firebase serve`
1. Deploy to firebase: `firebase deploy`
**NOTE:** You can use `firebase serve` to test how your application will work when deployed to Firebase, but make sure you run `npm run build` first.

## FAQ

1. Why node `6.11.5` instead of a newer version? [Cloud Functions runtime is still on `6.11.5`][functions-runtime-url], which is why that is what is used for the travis build version. This will be switched when the functions runtime is updated
1. Why Yarn over node's `package-lock.json`? - Relates to previous question. Node `6.*.*` and equivalent npm didn't include lock files yet.
1. Uploading service accounts? Where do they go and how are my service accounts stored?
  Currently on a Google Cloud Storage Bucket which does not have CORS access. There is also the option to store them in Firestore as an encrypted string for quicker reads/writes when running actions.


## What Happened To The Fireadmin NPM Library?

It is now deprecated. It may come back in the future as a support library for Fireadmin.
